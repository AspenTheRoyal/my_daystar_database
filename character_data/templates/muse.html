<p>Hello! Here's some information about the muse levels I use on this website.</p>

<p>🔴 - Red muse. This means that if I had to start all over again, I wouldn't be too quick to submit this character. Please don't ask to roleplay with them, the only reason
    I don't drop these is so I don't have to go through the submission process again. (NOTE: If you're reading this before Daystar opens up, atm red is a marker for myself to remember not to submit them,
    or drop them if I have because I have so little motivation)
</p>
<p>🟠 - Orange muse. This means that my muse with this character isn't super high, but I still vibe with them. Please don't ask to roleplay with them, if I feel inspired enough
    to use them for a certain scenario, I'll probably bring it up. I just need something specific to spark my inspiration. I normally write about a paragraph with these characters.
</p>
<p>🟡 - Yellow muse. Generally good for most roleplays. I do actively want to use them and seek out opportunities to use them, but it still
depends on the scenario. Sometimes I'll be happy to write two paragraphs, sometimes I'm just not feeling it. In general,
feel free to ask about these though!
</p>
<p>🟢 - Green muse. High muse, would love to use them! They're good for literate roleplays and I'll rarely say no to using one of these. I can control how much I write with
    these characters and generally enjoy using them.
</p>
<p>🔵 - Blue muse. I often go out of my way to think of a roleplay idea just to use these characters. Do not roleplay with these characters
    if you are not prepared for regular two or more discord message replies. Jokes aside, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE CHARACTERS. PLEASE I AM
    BEGGING YOU ROLEPLAY WITH THEM.
